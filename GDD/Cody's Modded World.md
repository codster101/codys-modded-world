# Minecraft BUT, You are Creating an Empire
- Expand you base into an empire by working with NPCs(citizens), exploring dungeons, killing mobs and bosses, and building systems to mass-automate resource gathering
- To sustain your growing empire you will need more resources, rarer resources, and more powerful tools and items
---------------------------
- NPCs have systems, needs, culture
- Integrate them into your city
- They give you rewards
- You can build buildings and systems to get more blocks
- You'll need to explore deeper and further to find resources to upgrade your empire
- You will need to ensure your cities are safe from hostile mobs and raids

## [[MVP]]
### [[Core Pillars and Game Loop.canvas|Core Pillars and Game Loop]]
- Creativity
- [[Explore|Exploration]]
- Survival
#### New Emphasis: ==Expanding==
- Constant and infinite expansion
- After everything is unlocked you should be able to continue play by upgrading, growing, and physically expanding outward
### Game Loop: Gather Resources -> Expand Base

### [[Progression.canvas|Progression Flow]]
- Era Based (Stone-> Iron -> Diamond)
	- Stone -> Bronze -> Iron/Steel -> Rare Metal -> Mystic/High-Tech/etc.
- Population based progression
	- Need x amount of people/houses/area to unlock iron recipes/tools
- Need to find/earn recipes 
	- Instead of automatically getting them
	- Can be found in chests
	- Traded for
	- Given by doing quests
	- Skill points block recipe groups

Idea #1
- Start off with some recipes
- Establishing a "City Hall" gives you a main quest line
- Each quest must be done linearly
- Each quest gives access to a recipe group
- Quests are base-related

- Other recipes can be gained by exploring/side-quests/defeating bosses/etc.
- Ages should lock systems to make blocks not necessarily the blocks themselves
	- In the stone age you can still get iron but you cannot create a system to mass produce it

- Player starts an Age
- To advance it needs to gather x amount of resources and/or craft x amount of items
	- Gathering the items involves some/all of the following:
		- Exploring
		- Crafting
		- Expanding the base
		- Farming
		- Building systems
		- Growing population
- Player goes to the next Age
- Repeat

| - Keeps progression focused on base-building<br>- Can still gather some resources but can't utilize them until you base has reached a certain criteria<br> | - Will hard lock Iron/Diamond/etc. behind certain acievements |



## Main Focus of Mod: ==Base-Building==
Everything done in this mod should be done to build on base-building
- Systems to allow bases to be more immersive
- Systems that allow big bases to be built if the correct infrastructure is in place

Start by gathering wood and building small house
Can then get stone
Establish a city hall
- Will need block(s) that will allow you to start expanding your base
- Area within your control will have perks and you can build more things there
- If mobs get to your city hall it will become a spawner
Protect your base
- Blocks can be broken by mobs
- Certain barricade blocks will have increased durability for defense
- Can craft different defenses to protect your base
Friendly mobs within your base will repopulate and can be used to help acquire blocks
